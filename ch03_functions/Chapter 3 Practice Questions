Practice Projects
For practice, write programs to do the following tasks.

The Collatz Sequence
Write a function named collatz() that has one parameter named number. If number is even, then collatz() should print number // 2 and return this value. If number is odd, then collatz() should print and return 3 * number + 1.

Then write a program that lets the user type in an integer and that keeps calling collatz() on that number until the function returns the value 1. (Amazingly enough, this sequence actually works for any integer—sooner or later, using this sequence, you’ll arrive at 1! Even mathematicians aren’t sure why. Your program is exploring what’s called the Collatz sequence, sometimes called “the simplest impossible math problem.”)

Remember to convert the return value from input() to an integer with the int() function; otherwise, it will be a string value.

Hint: An integer number is even if number % 2 == 0, and it’s odd if number % 2 == 1.

The output of this program could look something like this:


Enter number:
3
10
5
16
8
4
2
1
Input Validation
Add try and except statements to the previous project to detect whether the user types in a noninteger string. Normally, the int() function will raise a ValueError error if it is passed a noninteger string, as in int('puppy'). In the except clause, print a message to the user saying they must enter an integer.

# Chapter 3 Practice Question Answers

Q1. Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update.

Q2. The code in a function executes when the function is called, not when the function is defined.

Q3. The def statement defines (that is, creates) a function.

Q4. A function consists of the def statement and the code in its def clause.
A function call is what moves the program execution into the function, and the function call evaluates to the function’s return value.

Q5. There is one global scope, and a local scope is created whenever a function is called.

Q6. When a function returns, the local scope is destroyed, and all the variables in it are forgotten.

Q7. A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to. Like any value, a return value can be used as part of an expression.

Q8. If there is no return statement for a function, its return value is None.

Q9. A global statement will force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable.

Q10. The data type of None is NoneType.

Q11. That import statement imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic. (This isn’t a real Python module, by the way.)

Q12. This function can be called with spam.bacon().

Q13. Place the line of code that might cause an error in a try clause.

Q14. The code that could potentially cause an error goes in the try clause.
The code that executes if an error happens goes in the except clause.
