- Functions are like a mini-program inside your program.
- A scope can be thought of as an area of the source code, and as a
  container of variables.
- The global scope is code outside of all functions. Variables
  assigned here are global variables.
- Each function's code is in its own local scope. Variables assigned
  here local variables.
- Code in the global scope cannot use any local variables.
- Code in a function's local scope cannot use variables in any
  other function's local scope.
- If there's an assignment statement for a variable in a function,
  that is a local variable.
- Stating global and then the variable name makes a local variable
  become a global variable. For example:
  def spam():
    global eggs
    eggs = 'Hello'
    print(eggs)

eggs = 42
spam()
print(eggs)
